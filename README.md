Hello, this is a tool to convert your chess.com profile into a image, (or html file) to add to your github page or anything else! This was stressful, but after 2 days, its finally done! enjoy! also, you need
```bash
pip install flask requests imgkit
```
also imgkit needs something, im too lazy to provide a link. so yeah, idk whats its called also. i already spent all my time on this.
```url's:
/image?user=[username]
/html?user=[username]
```
